To get the optimal solution for very small sized problems (graphs containing less than 25 vertices), 
we used backtracking. Notice that even though backtracking gives us an optimal solution, a greedy or memetic 
algorithm may not. By applying this method (backtracking, memetic or greedy algorithm depending on the number of 
vertices) recursively, we have at each step a graph as input, and the two subgraphs induced by each of the sets of 
the vertex partition as output; stopping when we arrive to a graph with just one vertex, we generate a hierarchical 
clustering in a top-down fashion.''',

In the Ramanchandran plot three residues are found in disallowed regions. The electron density of these residues 
supports the modeled conformation. In both HE monomers present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of 
free as well as ligandbound HE, the active site region of the esterase domain is largely disordered. No electron 
density is observed for esterase domain residues A52-A59, B51-B59, A108-A114, A308-A314, A335-A347 and B338-B346, 
while residues 44-50, 60-72, 332-334, and 348-358 adopt different conformations in the two monomers. 
Modeling of chain A residues 397-401 and chain B residues 334-337 and 394-398 should be considered tentative. 
C-terminal residues 396-403 followed by the 7-residue thrombin recognition sequence of the cleavable Fc-fusion are 
stabilized by crystal packing interactions suggesting that the observed conformation is not physiologically relevant. 
Stick representation of aNeu4,5,9Ac 3 2Me in gray with (left) the 5-N-Acand 9-O-Ac-or (right) the 4-O-Ac-and 5-N-Ac-groups 
colored in red (oxygen), blue (nitrogen) and cyan (carbon). Arrows indicate the distances between Ac methyl groups and 
asterisks the position of the O2 atom through which Sia would be linked to the penultimate residue of the glycan chain. 
The patch that accommodates the Sia-5-N-Ac group in BCoV-Mebus HE, and the newly formed pocket that accommodates 
the Sia-4-O-Ac group in MHV-S HE are colored in cyan. The pockets that harbor the Sia-9-O-Ac group in BCoV-Mebus 
HE and now accommodates the Sia-5-N-Ac group in MHV-S HE are colored in green. (B) Surface representation of the 
MHV-S HE receptor binding site with Neu5,9Ac 2 2Me modeled in silico in a topology corresponding to that in BCoV HE. 
The model predicts that 9-O-Ac-Sia will not be accepted as ligand because of (i) the spatial arrangement of the two
 hydrophobic pockets at too close a distance of each other and (ii) a clash of the Sia carboxylate with residues of 
 the extended R3 loop.
