101,"COVID-19","To get the optimal solution for very small sized problems (graphs containing less than 25 vertices),
we used backtracking. Notice that even though backtracking gives us an optimal solution, a greedy or memetic
algorithm may not. By applying this method (backtracking, memetic or greedy algorithm depending on the number of
vertices) recursively, we have at each step a graph as input, and the two subgraphs induced by each of the sets of
the vertex partition as output; stopping when we arrive to a graph with just one vertex, we generate a hierarchical
clustering in a top-down fashion."
